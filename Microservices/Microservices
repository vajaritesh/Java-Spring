-	What is Microservices Architecture:
	-	Introduction
		-	"Microservices" is not a new word
			-	Term coined in 2005 by Dr Peter Rodgers
				-	Then called "micro web services" and based on SOAP
			-	Term started to become popular since 2010
				-	Proposed by a group of architects in Venice during 2011
				-	Used in 2012 in a presentation from James Lewis
				-	Meanwhile Adrian Cockcroft(Netflix), was describing this approach as "fine grained SOA"
				
	-	Without Microservices:
		-	Using a "monolith" architecture
			-	All-in-One application

	-	With Microservices:
		-	Many application divided into a set of sub-applications
			-	called microservices

-	Pros & Cons of Microservices
	-	Core Spring Concepts : Applied to Application Architecture
	-	Spring enables separation-of-concerns
		-	Loose Coupling: Effect of change is isolated
		-	Tight Cohesion: Code performs a single well-defined task
	-	Microservices exhibit the same strengths
		-	Loose Coupling
			-	Applications are build from collaborating services (processes)
			-	Can change independently so long as protocols unchanged
		-	Tight Cohesion
			-	An application (service) that deals with a single view of data
			-	Also knows as "Bounded Contexts" (Domain-Driven Design)

	-	Microservice Benefits:
		-	Smaller code base is easy to maintain
		-	Easy to scale
			-	Scale individual component
		-	Technology diversity
			-	Mix libraries, frameworks, data storage, languages
		-	Fault Isolation
			-	Component failure should not bring whole system down
		-	Better support for smaller, parallel teams
		-	Independent deployment
		
	-	Microservice Challenges:
		-	Difficult to achieve strong consistency across services
			-	ACID transactions do not span multiple processes
			-	Eventual consistency, Compensating transactions
		-	Distributed system				
			-	Harder to debug/trace
			-	Greater need for end-toend testing
			-	Expect, test for and handle the failure of any process
			-	More components to maintain: redundancy, HA
		-	Typically requires "cultural" change( (Dev Ops)
			-	How applications are developed and deployed
			-	Devs and Ops working together, even on same team!	
	
	-	Use a Platform to Support This:
		-	Platforms like Pivotal Cloud Foundry aid deployment
			-	Easily run, scale, monitor and recover multiple processes
			-	Run up a complete dev system for end-to-end testing
		-	Support for
			-	Continuous Deployment
			-	Rolling upgrades of new versions of code
				-	Also termed: Blue/Green or Canary rollout
				-	Quick rollback in case of defects
			-	Running multiple versions of same service at same time
				-	Makes migration easiser for downstream projects					
															
						
-	Developing Microservices:
	-	Microservice Infrastructure:
		-	Multiple processes working together
		-	Issues that now arise:
			-	How do they find each other?	(Service Discovery)
			-	How do we decide which isntance to use?	(Client-side Load Balancing)
			-	What happens if a microservice is not responding? (Fault Tolerance)
			-	How do we control access?	(OAuth, ...)
			-	How do they communicate?	(Messaing Service)
			-	To just name a few!						
		
			Note- We only cover Service Discovery and Client-Side Load Balancing
			
	-	Microservices made-easy by Spring:
		-	Setup a new service using Spring Boot
		-	Expose resources via a RestController
		-	Consume remove services using RestTemplate
		-	Will leverage capabilities from Spring Cloud Project
					
		-	What is Spring Cloud:
			-	Building blocks for Cloud and Microservices applications:
				-	Microservices Infrastructure
					-	Provides useful services such as Service Discovery, Configuration Server and Monitoring
				-	Several based on other Open Source projects
					-	Netfix OSS, HashiCorp's Consul,...
				-	Platform Support
					-	Access platform-specific information and services
						-	Available for Cloud Foundry, AWS and Heroku				
				-	Uses Spring Boot style starters
					-	Requires Spring Boot to work
					
		-	Spring Cloud Usage Example:
			-	There are many use cases supported by Spring Cloud
				-	Cloud Integration, Dynamic Reconfiguration, Service Discovery, Security, Data Integration
			-	Today we concentrate on microservices support
				-	Service Discovery
					-	How do the services find each other?
				-	Client Side Load Balancing
					-	Each service typically deployed as multiple instances
						-	For fault-tolerance and load-sharing
					-	How do we decide which service instance to use?
			
			-	Why we need Service Discovery - 1
				-	Various protocols may be used 
					-	But how do the two services find each other?
					-	What happens if we run multiple instances?

		-	Implementing Service Discovery:
			-	Spring Cloud supports several
				-	We will use Eureka
					-	Created by Netflix
				-	Consul.io is another opion
					-	Hashicorp project (inventor of Vargrant)
			-	Spring Cloud makes it easy
				-	To utilize either of those servers
				-	Hiding their internal complexity
				 		
		-	Implementing Client-Side Load Balancing:
			-	Discovery server may return the location of multiple instances
				-	Recall: multiple instance for resilience and load-sharing
				-	Client needs to pick one
			-	We will use Netflix Ribbon
				-	Provides severla algorithms for client side load balancing
			-	Spring provides a smart RestTemplate
				-	Service-discovery and load-balancing built-in
				-	@LoadBalanced
	
-	Building a Simple Microservice System:
	-	Simple Microservice System:

									data from
									
	-	Building Simple Microservice System:
		A)	Run a Discovery Service
			-	We will see how to create Eureka Discvoery Service
		B)	Run a Microservice (the Producer)
			-	Ensure it register itself with the Discovery Service
			-	Registers its logical service name with A			
		C)	How to Microservice Consumers find Servcie B?			
			-	Discovery client using a "smart" RestTemplate
				-	Spring perform service look up for you
				-	Uses logical service names in URLs
			
		Dependencies for A, B & C. Spring Cloud is based on Spring Boot										
		Maven Dependencies:

		        			^ Access Eureka registry server 
			</dependency>
		￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</dependencies>	
		
	A) 	Eureka Server using Spring Cloud
		-	All you need to implement your own registry server!
		application.yml:
			server:	
				port: 8761
	
			eureka:
				instance:
	  				hostname: localhost
	  
				client:  # Not a client
				  	registerWithEureka: false
		 	 		fetchRegistry: false			
	 	Main.java:
		@SpringBootApplication
		@EnableEurekaServer
		public class EurekaApplication {			
			public static void main(String[] args) {				
				SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class, args);
			}
		}
		pom.xml:		
		￼<dependency>		
    		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
	B)	Accounts Producer Microservice: Perform Service Registration
		-	Microservice declares itself as an available resource
			-	Using @EnableDiscoveryClient
			-	Registers using its application name
		
		@SpringBootApplication		
		@EnableDiscoveryClient		
		public class AccountsApplication {		
		    public static void main(String[] args) {		    		        
		        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
			}
		}
		
		spring:
			￼application:
			name: accounts-microservice	<---- Service Name			
		eureka:
			client:
				￼serviceUrl:
					defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
											^ Eureka Server URL

			 	
	C)	Consumer Service - Step 1: Enable our consumer to find the producer
		-	Same annotation also allows service lookup
		@SpringBootApplication
		@EnableDiscoveryClient	<-- Same annotation as B) - allows us to query Discovery Server to find microservices
		public class FrontEndApplication	{
			public static void main(Strings[] args)	{
				SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
			}
			//Will send this template to access the microservice 
			//Spring will enhance this to do service discovery
			@Bean 
			@LoadBalaced
			public RestTemplate restTemplate()	{
				return new RestTemplate();
			}
		}
	C)	Consumer Service - Step 2: Let our consumer use the producer
		@Service
		public class RemoteAccountManager implements AccountService {
			// Spring injects the “smart” service-aware template
			// defined on previous slide
			// It performs a load-balanced lookup (see next slide)
			@Autowired
			@LoadBalanced
			RestTemplate restTemplate;

			public Account findAccount(String id) {
				// Fetch data
				return restTemplate.getForObject
				("http://accounts-microservice/accounts/{id}", Account.class, id);
								^ Service name
				
			￼￼}
		 }

		-	Load Balanced RestTemplate
			-	Create using @LoadBalanced and @Qaulifier
				-	Spring enhances it to do service lookup & load-balancing
			@Bean
			@LoadBalanced
			public RestTemplate restTemplate {
				return new RestTemplate();
			}
			
			-	Inject using @Qualifier
				-	If there are multiple RestTemplates you get the right one
				-	Can be used to access multiple microservices
				@Autowired
				@LoadBalanced
				RestTemplate restTemplate;
				
		-	Load Balancing with Ribbon:
			-	Spring "smart" RestTemplate automatically integrate two Netflix utilities
				-	"Eureka" service discovery
				-	"Ribbon" client-side load-balancer		
			-	End Resut
				-	Eureka returns the URL of all available instances
				-	Ribbon determines the best available service to use
			-	Just inject the load-balanced RestTemplate
				-	Automatically look up by logical service-name
